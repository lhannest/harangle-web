# Harangle Web

This repository contains the login and settings page prototypes for Harangle. Both pages rely on mocked data so they can be opened directly in a browser without running a server.

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the login page. If the Google sign-in script is unavailable, a mock button allows you to proceed to the settings page.
- Open `settings.html` to view the settings page where you can edit your username, choose calendars, and review events.
