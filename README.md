# Harangle Web

This repository contains prototypes for Harangle's login, group list, settings, and calendar pages. All pages rely on mocked data so they can be opened directly in a browser without running a server.

- Open `index.html` in a browser to view the login page. If the Google sign-in script is unavailable, a mock button allows you to proceed to the groups page.
- Open `groups.html` to browse existing groups or create a new one. Selecting a group opens `calendar.html` with that group's ID.
- Open `settings.html` to edit your username, choose calendars, and review events.
